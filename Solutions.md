**A. Customer Journey**

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

``` sql

SELECT s.customer_id,
       s.plan_id,
       p.plan_name,
       s.start_date
   FROM subscriptions s
      JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id  = s.plan_id 
   WHERE customer_id = 1 
     OR  customer_id = 2

	   OR customer_id = 18 
	   OR customer_id = 19 
	 ORDER BY customer_id ASC

Customer 1 signed up for the trial and the following the trial downgraded to the basic monthly, instead of keeping the automatic pro monthly.

Customer 2 signed up for the trial and before the end of the trial upgraded to the pro annual.

Customer 11 signed up for the trial and cancelled after the trial expired.

Customer 13 signed up for the trial and the following the trial downgraded to the basic monthly, instead of keeping the automatic pro monthly. After a week on the basic monthly plan they upgraded up to pro monthly.

Customer 15  signed up for the trial and the following the trial stayed on the automatic pro monthly plan before cancelling 5 days later.

Customer 16 signed up for the trial and the following the trial downgraded to the basic monthly, instead of keeping the automatic pro monthly. After two weeks on basic monthly customer 16 upgraded to pro monthly.

**C. Challenge Payment Question**

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan

upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately

upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period

once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

```sql

                                c.plan_id,
